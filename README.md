# Open DJ

A hobby project to build a controller from scratch. Built with [Tauri 2.0](https://tauri.app) and [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev) (TypeScript).

The ultimate goal is to get an app that allows you to mix with nothing but your keyboard.
We'll need to support all the functionality of a controller and have some clever keybinds to allow for easy transitions.
Haven't worked that last part out yet.

## Running

```shell
bun run tauri dev
```
